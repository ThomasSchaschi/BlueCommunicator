 Welcome to BlueCommunicator!

 - a flexible terminal bluetooth trans-
 mission application.

 How it works:
 1. Device identifies whether bluetooth
 is activated or even supported on the
 device itself. If that is not the case,
 no devices will be identified by the
 application.

2. When devices are discovered,
 (!Note that only devices which have
 been paired previously can be detected!)
 a connection can be established.

3. Afterwards the user is ment to switch
 into terminal mode were he (or "she"
 for political correctness)can send
 whichever commands he/she wants to
 the paired device. - also, this is
 where received messages are displayed.

 Please do not leave this mode until
 you have completed your operations.


 -UPDATES will follow soon!
